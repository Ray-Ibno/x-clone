# X-CLONE TODO

Planning to make this web app a complete app in the future, including complex features you see in the actual X social media like video calls, subscriptions, etc.

## High Priority

- [x] Only get users that had previous chat with
- [x] Add a message button in the profile page that redirects to chat page when clicked
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [x] Fix bug where if you go to /chat from /chat/userid, the contacusers do not show
- [ ] When sending a message to someone for the first time, it should show up in real time

## Low Priority

- [ ] ProfilePage component is too bloated
- [ ] Optimize with useCallback/memo and useMemo
- [ ] Fix repeated codes in api stores and hooks
- [ ] Load older messages when scrolled up
